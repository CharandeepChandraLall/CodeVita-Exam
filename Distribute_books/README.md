# Distribute Books

The question was asked in Codevita Examination 2019

## Problem Statement

For enhancing the book reading, the school distributed storybooks to students as part of the Childrenâ€™s day celebrations.
To increase the reading habit, the class teacher decided to exchange books every week so that everyone will have a different book to read. She wants to know how many unique exchanges are possible in such a way that students don't repeat the book.

## Explaination

The problem can be solved in two ways:

1. Formula Method
2. Closest Integer Method

### Method 1

In this method, we need to find the subfactorial (unique combinations) of the given integer by using the formula.

#### !n = (n-1)(!(n-1) + !(n-2))

### Method 2

In this method, when we divide factorial by exponential (e = 2.71828) gives the closest number to the subfactorial of the given integer.
