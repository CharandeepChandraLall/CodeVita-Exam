# Reverse Gear

The question was asked in Codevita Examination 2015

## Problem Statement

A futuristic company is building an autonomous car. The scientists at the company are training the car to perform Reverse parking. To park, the car needs to be able to move in backward as well as forward direction. The car is programmed to move backwards B meters and forwards again, say F meters, in a straight line. The car does this repeatedly until it is able to park or collides with other objects. The car covers 1 meter in T units of time. There is a wall after distance D from car's initial position in the backward direction.

The car is currently not without defects and hence often hits the wall. The scientists are devising a strategy to prevent this from happening. Your task is to help the scientists by providing them with exact information on amount of time available before the car hits the wall.
