# Philaland Coins

The question was asked in Codevita Examination 2019

## Problem Statement

The problem solvers have found a new Island for coding and named it as Philaland.

These smart people were given a task to make purchase of items at the Island easier by distributing various coins with different value.

Manish has come up with a solution that if we make coins category starting from $1 till the maximum price of item present on Island, then we can purchase any item easily. He added following example to prove his point.

Letâ€™s suppose the maximum price of an item is 5$ then we can make coins of {$1, $2, $3, $4, $5} to purchase any item ranging from $1 till $5.

Now Manisha, being a keen observer suggested that we could actually minimize the number of coins required and gave following distribution {$1, $2, $3}.

According to him any item can be purchased one time ranging from $1 to $5. Everyone was impressed with both of them.

Your task is to help Manisha come up with minimum number of denominations for any arbitrary max price in Philaland.

## Explaination

The problem wants us to find the minimum numbers of coins required to satisfy all the count from 0 to N (maximum price).
So here the solution, we need to configure that in our daily life we have only **10 rupees coin**, **5 rupees coin**, **2 rupees coin**, and **1 rupee coin**. That means, our solution will be having only **10 rupees coin**, **5 rupees coin**, **2 rupees coin**, and **1 rupee coin**. 

Firstly, we need to find the **count of 10 rupees coin**. This can be configured by **dividing the N (maximum price) by 10** and get the quotient but **the count of 10 rupees coin will be always 1 less** than the quotient which we obtained.

Next, **5 rupees coin can be obtained by dividing the remainder** (i.e the amount left after removing the total amount made by 10 rupees coins) **by 5**. If the quotient is **odd then we have two 5 rupees coins** else **one 5 rupees coin**.

Now, we can have a **count of 1 rupee coin** by extracting the whole amount contributed by 10 rupees coins and 5 rupees coins. Once, the amount is extracted then the left amount will be either odd or even. If the amount is **odd then the number of 1 rupee coins is 1 and 2 if it is even**.

Lastly, extract the total amount contributed 10 rupees coins, 5 rupees coins, and 1 rupee coins. Then **divide the remaining amount by 2 the quotient obtained will be the count of 2 rupee coins**.
